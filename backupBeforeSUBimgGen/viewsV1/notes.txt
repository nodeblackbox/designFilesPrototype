This is my goal and I will achieve it Affirmations 

I want to make a website that will allow users to generate Images using text to image artificial intelligence The website should accommodate for all types of users and it should have many different functionalities As well as a database

They will pay a monthly subscription Of tier 1 tier 2 or tier 3 And the subscriptions will include a bundle of different things 

There are also be a Up so that they could use different Extensions to enhance their generations that they create

 these extensions would be things like having Laura models or Having position or data to pose the models in different ways or 

Having the ability to make content so a little thing that would maybe make The videos that they have and edit them for them using artificial intelligence and make content for them And they will be able to use the images that they are generating to do that as well

 then there'll be like extensions as well that they could buy Like voice Synthesis And voice cloning These are all facilities and functionalities of the website

 now the extension store  will be a extensions shop Where they can pick different extensions and then they can go to a product page which is going to be a template page And there'll be different images for the product and then also there will be A description and they will be able to abide their product Once the product is bought it will be added To there plan Extension can be a one-time payment or it can be a monthly recurring payment
